# Recognition-and-Tracking-w-YOLOv4

It is a transfer learning model implementation that detects and tracks objects with YOLOv4 using the COCO dataset as data. [yoloV4_pretrained_camera.py](yoloV4_pretrained_camera.py) file is for detection through web cameras. [yoloV4_pretrained_image.py](yoloV4_pretrained_image.py) is for detection on images and [yoloV4_pretrained_video.py](yoloV4_pretrained_video.py) is for detection through videos.
